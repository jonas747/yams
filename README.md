# Yet another minecraft server

So here i was playing minecraft when it started lagging and i said to myself "shitty fucking devs ima make my own minecraft server" so here i am.

Probably not gonna turn into something good but ill mess around with it atleast, see what fun comes from it.

(there is no real play functionality on it, so don't bother trying it)
